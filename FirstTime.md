# F1 Wing Basics - Beginner Project (First Time In GitHub)

This is a simple project where I explore the aerodynamics of a Formula 1 front wing.

## Goals

- Understand F1 wing shapes
- Learn basic aero concepts
- Start building a portfolio!

## What I Learned

- F1 wings generate **downforce** by redirecting airflow.
- The **angle of attack** affects pressure difference on top/bottom.
