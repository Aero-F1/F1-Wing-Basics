# F1 Wing Basics - Beginner Project (First Time In GitHub)

This is a simple project where I explore the aerodynamics of a Formula 1 front wing.

## Goals

- Understand F1 wing shapes
- Learn basic aero concepts
- Start building a portfolio!

## What I Learned

- F1 wings generate **downforce** by redirecting airflow.
- The **angle of attack** affects pressure difference on top/bottom.

## Parts of the Front Wing

- The front wing (or the main plane) is suspended from the nose and runs along the entire length of the Formula One car. To this main plane, adjustable flaps are attached, and at the ends of the main plane, the endplates are attached

### **Endplates**

- They control the flow of air around the Formula One car by redirecting the airflow around the tires
- This minimizes the overall drag resistance produced and facilitates the airflow to continue back to the side pods and the car floor. 
es of the end plates are curved to ensure that the air flows around the tires,to decrease turbulence in front of the wheels and decrease drag.
